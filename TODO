Features:
  * Clicking *save* when working on multiple avs... should it save them all, or only the current one?
  * Warn about closing with unsaved files still open

Bugs:
  * when editing multiple animations, switching between them with a part selected causes both avs to be set to the data for one of them
  * clicking "cancel" in File load dialog, then clicking the view area, causes a segfault
  * Sliders and value inputs don't seem to affect anything (have to edit in the view area, with the mouse)

Untested:
  * Saving / data integrity when working with multiple avs
