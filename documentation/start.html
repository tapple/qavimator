<h2>Getting Started - Your First Animation</h2>

<p>Start up QAvimator. You will see a window that looks roughly like this:</p>

<p><img src="screenshots/start_new_animation.png" /></p>

<p>We don't pay much attention to most of the controls on the screen just yet. First of all
let us create a quick animation to see, how the general concept of QAvimator looks like.</p>

<p><pre>
- Start QAvimator
- Make sure, Options / Show Timeline is checked
- Make sure, Options / Protect First Frame is checked
- Click on abdomen
- Observe a circle shaped key frame has been created
- This means, this key frame does not change anything, but we need it as "anchor"
- Move timeline bar to Frame number 10
- Click on abdomen
- Move X slider to the right until it says 80
- Observe the circle becoming a triangle and another triangle getrs created
- Move timeline bar ro Frame number 15
- Click on Abdomen
- Another circle gets created (another anchor for us)
- Move timeline bar to Frame number 25
- Click on Abdomen
- Move X slider bach to 0
- Again, the circle turns to a triangle, and another triangle appears
- That's it, you now have a very simple "bow" animation
- Click "File / Save As..." and save it under "bow.avm"
